### This is part of the selection process for a full-stack role.
### This project was developed to upload CSV files and render data on the screen using any CSV structure. It can also filter data by any CSV column, allowing users to type in an input text for filtering. 

### The application is responsive and can be used on various devices, including mobile phones, desktop computers, and tablets.
